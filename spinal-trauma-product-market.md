<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Spinal Trauma Product Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Spinal Fusion</li><li>Non-fusion Products</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The spinal trauma product market is divided into two main types: spinal fusion products and non-fusion products. Spinal fusion products are designed to stabilize the spine by merging adjacent vertebrae, often involving hardware like rods and screws. In contrast, non-fusion products focus on stabilizing the spine without permanently joining vertebrae, employing dynamic systems like interspinous spacers or motion-preserving devices. Both types aim to alleviate pain, restore function, and improve quality of life for individuals suffering from spinal injuries.</p></p>
