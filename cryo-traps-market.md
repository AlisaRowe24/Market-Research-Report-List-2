<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cryo Traps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Internally Cooled Cryo Traps</li><li>Externally Cooled Cryo Traps</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Cryo Traps market is segmented into two main types: internally cooled and externally cooled cryo traps. Internally cooled cryo traps utilize internal coils or surfaces chilled by cryogenic fluids to capture vapors and gases, providing efficient condensation and trapping. Externally cooled cryo traps, on the other hand, rely on external cooling mechanisms, such as liquid nitrogen jackets, to lower the temperature of the trap without direct internal cooling. Both types serve to improve vacuum system performance by minimizing contamination and enhancing purity.</p></p>
