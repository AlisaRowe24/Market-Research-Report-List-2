<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Organic Liquid Photoresist Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Photoresist</li><li>Negative Photoresist</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Organic Liquid Photoresist market is primarily divided into two types: positive and negative photoresists. Positive photoresists become soluble when exposed to light, allowing the desired pattern to be developed easily. This type is widely used in photolithography for its high resolution and detail. Conversely, negative photoresists cross-link and become insoluble when exposed to light, forming a stable pattern that remains after development. Both types serve critical roles in semiconductor manufacturing and various microfabrication processes, catering to different application requirements.</p></p>
