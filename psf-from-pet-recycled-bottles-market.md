<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PSF from PET Recycled Bottles Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Mechanical</li><li>Chemical</li></ul></p>
<p><p>PSF, or Polyester Staple Fiber, derived from recycled PET bottles, is classified into two primary market types: mechanical and chemical. The mechanical market involves the physical recycling process, where PET bottles are cleaned, chopped, and processed into fibers without altering their chemical structure. In contrast, the chemical market utilizes a more advanced method, breaking down PET into its base components, which are then repolymerized to create new fibers. Both processes contribute to sustainability efforts by reducing plastic waste and promoting circular economy practices.</p></p>
