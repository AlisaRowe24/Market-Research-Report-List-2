<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-targeted contrast-enhanced ultrasound</li><li>Targeted contrast-enhanced ultrasound</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The contrast-enhanced ultrasound market is divided into two primary types: non-targeted and targeted contrast-enhanced ultrasound. Non-targeted contrast-enhanced ultrasound uses microbubbles to enhance the overall image quality without specific cellular targeting, useful for broad assessments in various applications. In contrast, targeted contrast-enhanced ultrasound aims to selectively visualize specific tissues or diseases, enabling more precise diagnosis and treatment monitoring. Both types enhance traditional ultrasound by improving the visualization of vascular structures and pathological changes, enhancing clinical outcomes.</p></p>
