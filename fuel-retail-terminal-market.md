<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fuel Retail Terminal Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Submersible Systems</li><li>Suction Systems</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fuel retail terminals utilize two main market types: submersible systems and suction systems. Submersible systems incorporate pumps submerged in the fuel storage tank, providing efficient fuel delivery and minimizing vapor loss. Conversely, suction systems use surface-mounted pumps that draw fuel from the tank through pipes. Each system has its advantages; submersible systems offer quieter operation and reduced maintenance, while suction systems allow for easier access and troubleshooting. The choice between them depends on site-specific requirements and operational preferences.</p></p>
